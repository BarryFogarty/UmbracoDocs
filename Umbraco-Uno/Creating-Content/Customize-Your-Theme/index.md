# Customize Your theme

Your theme lets you add your touch to your page, meaning the colors you want, the font, and all that. firstly if you are new to working with Umbraco Uno and do not yet know how to work with the [Theme](../../Getting-Started/Themes/index.md) then it is recommended that you take a look.

## How to customize your theme through the theme editor

We will be working with the theme editor, you can access this by going to the preview section of the unicorn hotel page.

### Picking the colors and text of the theme

First what we will need to do is click the green button that looks like a paintbrush, then the theme editor will show up.
The theme we will be setting up will be a watermelon theme, and it will look like this:

![watermelon theme](images/theme.gif)

If you want a colored theme you will have to go to the Hero Widget and set the overlay to 0 otherwise the color you choose for background color will be put on top of your hero image
::::

1. Select ***Theme*** and press in the field and type in the value you see on this image:
